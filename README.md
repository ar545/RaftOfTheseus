## Description
Players assume the role of Theseus, the sole survivor of a shipwreck with no way home. Using the remains of the wrecked ship, Theseus builds a raft – a raft that is constantly falling apart. As the raft disintegrates, players must strategically gather driftwood to repair the raft and prevent it from sinking. Players must direct Theseus through the treacherous seas, navigate around obstacles, and evade ferocious monsters to reach land in one piece.
