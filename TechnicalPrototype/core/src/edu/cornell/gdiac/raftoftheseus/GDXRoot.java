/*
 * GDXRoot.java
 *
 * This is the primary class file for running the game.  It is the "static main" of
 * LibGDX.  In the first lab, we extended ApplicationAdapter.  In previous lab
 * we extended Game.  This is because of a weird graphical artifact that we do not
 * understand.  Transparencies (in 3D only) is failing when we use ApplicationAdapter. 
 * There must be some undocumented OpenGL code in setScreen.
 *
 * This time we shown how to use Game with player modes.  The player modes are 
 * implemented by screens.  Player modes handle their own rendering (instead of the
 * root class calling render for them).  When a player mode is ready to quit, it
 * notifies the root class through the ScreenListener interface.

 * Based on original Optimization Lab by Don Holden, 2007
