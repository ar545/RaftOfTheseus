/*
 * Ship.java
 *
 * This is a passive model, and this model does very little by itself.  
 * All of its work is done by the CollisionController or the 
 * GameplayController. 
 * 
 * This separation is very important for this class because it has a lot 
 * of interactions with other classes.  When a ship fires, it creates  
 * bullets. If did not move that behavior to the GameplayController,
 * then we would have to have a reference to the GameEngine in this
 * class. Tight coupling with the GameEngine is a very bad idea, so
 * we have separated this out.
