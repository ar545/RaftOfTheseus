/*
 * InputController.java
 *
 * This class buffers in input from the devices and converts it into its
 * semantic meaning. If your game had an option that allows the player to
 * remap the control keys, you would store this information in this class.
 * That way, the main GameEngine does not have to keep track of the current
 * key mapping.
 *
 * This class is a singleton for this application, but we have not designed
 * it as one.  That is to give you some extra functionality should you want
 * to add multiple ships.
